        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <p class="">All work no fun is never good and so somethings i personally am intrigued and involved in are Football, Playing Chess and a little bit of Gaming here and there. Chelsea is my club of preference in the glorious world of football and if you wanna have a civil debate on anything related to football be it from the play style of some legendary teams to the board management of them or even if you just wanna play this beautiful sport, count me in always. Chess is my go to indoor game for calming myself down when it comes to recreation, it helps me reliase the importance of patience and how sometimes just carefully observing things rather than just playing a short term safety move can help you make an exemplary move and help you reach goals much efficiently and quicker.</p>
